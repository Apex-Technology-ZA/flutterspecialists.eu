Why understand the rendering pipeline?

- Performance work demands a mental model: which thread is doing what, where time is spent, and how rendering decisions affect memory and jank.
- Advanced UI and data visualizations often need custom painting and explicit control of layers.

Overview of the pipeline

1. Widgets (immutable configuration)
   - Build methods create a widget tree every frame as needed.
2. Elements (stateful instantiation)
   - Bridge between widgets and render objects; manage lifecycle, update children.
3. RenderObjects (layout, paint, hit testing)
   - Stateful tree on the UI thread; computes layout and issues painting commands.
4. Layers (compositing)
   - Painted content becomes a layer tree (e.g., PictureLayer, TransformLayer); raster thread composites via Skia.

Threads

- UI thread (Dart): builds widgets, runs layout & paint (producing a layer tree).
- Raster thread (C++/Skia): consumes the layer tree, renders to GPU surfaces.
- Platform threads: I/O, GPU driver, async tasks.

Compositing and layers

- Each composited layer becomes a separate surface that the raster thread blends.
- More layers ≠ always bad; it’s about balancing overdraw and recomposition cost.
- Common layers: OpacityLayer, TransformLayer, ClipRectLayer, PictureLayer, ImageFilterLayer.

When to add a layer?

- Reuse: cache expensive picture content (`RepaintBoundary`) when subtrees don’t change frequently.
- Transform/clip/filter: isolate effects without repainting parents.
- Avoid unnecessary `RepaintBoundary`s; they add memory and compositing cost.

Repaint, layout, semantics

- Layout invalidation: size changes bubble up/down; avoid thrashing by constraining subtree layout.
- Paint invalidation: markNeedsPaint triggers repaint of that RenderObject subtree.
- Semantics tree: accessibility; keep it in sync without adding excessive depth.

CustomPainter fundamentals

- CustomPainter gives precise control over painting via a Canvas:
  - Efficient for charts, maps, gauges, custom decorations.
  - Use `shouldRepaint` wisely to avoid repainting when inputs unchanged.

Example: static vs dynamic painters

```dart
class StaticGridPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Color color;
  const StaticGridPainter(this.color);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final p = Paint()
      ..color = color
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
      ..strokeWidth = 1;
    for (double x = 0; x < size.width; x += 8) {
      canvas.drawLine(Offset(x, 0), Offset(x, size.height), p);
    }
    for (double y = 0; y < size.height; y += 8) {
      canvas.drawLine(Offset(0, y), Offset(size.width, y), p);
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant StaticGridPainter old) => old.color != color;
}
```

- Static inputs → minimal repaints (true only when color changes).

Example: animated painter (avoid extra allocations)

```dart
class SparklinePainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<double> values; // normalized 0..1
  final Color color;
  final double stroke;
  SparklinePainter(this.values, this.color, this.stroke);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final p = Paint()
      ..color = color
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
      ..strokeWidth = stroke
      ..isAntiAlias = true;

    final path = Path();
    if (values.isNotEmpty) {
      final dx = size.width / (values.length - 1).clamp(1, 1e9).toDouble();
      path.moveTo(0, size.height * (1 - values[0]));
      for (int i = 1; i < values.length; i++) {
        path.lineTo(dx * i, size.height * (1 - values[i]));
      }
    }
    canvas.drawPath(path, p);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant SparklinePainter old) =>
      !identical(values, old.values) || color != old.color || stroke != old.stroke;
}
```

- Prefer reusing `values` buffers; avoid per-frame allocations (`List.generate`) in `paint`.

RepaintBoundary and caching

- Wrap expensive painters in a `RepaintBoundary` to isolate repaints:
  - Only that subtree will be repainted if nothing else changes.
- Use `RepaintBoundary` sparingly; it increases memory and compositing overhead.

Pictures and PictureRecorder

- Capture static vector content once:
  - Use `ui.PictureRecorder` to pre-render content and then draw the `Picture` in subsequent frames.
  - Great for static backgrounds or heavy vector assets.

Hit testing for custom render

- CustomPainter supports hit testing by overriding `hitTest` via `CustomPainter.semanticsBuilder` and `isComplex` hints.
- For advanced interactivity, consider direct `RenderBox` subclassing to handle `hitTestSelf` and `handleEvent`.

Clipping, shadows, and filters

- Clipping creates extra layers; prefer rounded clip only where necessary.
- Shadows are expensive; batch shadows and consider pre-rendered assets for complex elevation stacks.
- Image filters (blur) can force offscreen rendering—profile and use sparingly.

Transformations

- Hardware-accelerated transforms are cheap if they avoid re-rasterization; but transformed children may need bigger clip regions.
- Animate transforms rather than repainting complex paths when appropriate.

Measuring performance

- DevTools Performance: profile UI/Raster times; record frames during interactions.
- Check “Widget rebuild stats” (Flutter inspector) to find noisy rebuilds.
- Turn on Performance Overlay to see frame budget and rasterization spikes.
- Profile in profile/release modes, not debug.

Common pitfalls

- Unbounded constraints in layout → layout passes explode; guard with SizedBox/constraints.
- Animate painting when transform would suffice → unnecessary repaint work.
- Overuse of `CustomPaint` for things the framework already handles efficiently.
- Misuse of `setState` causing broad rebuilds; lift state or use fine-grained controllers.

Layering patterns for complex UIs

- Background layer: static assets/pictures (cached).
- Midground layer: frequently updated but bounded areas (charts, cursors).
- Foreground layer: UI chrome and hit targets (hover/click).
- Isolate expensive painters into their own `RepaintBoundary`.

Checklist for high-performance custom rendering

- [ ] `shouldRepaint` is accurate (no repaint on unchanged inputs)
- [ ] No per-frame allocations in `paint` (reuse Paint, Path, buffers)
- [ ] Heavy static content cached via `Picture`
- [ ] RepaintBoundary used where isolation pays off
- [ ] Minimal clipping and shadows; profile if used
- [ ] Transform where possible instead of repainting
- [ ] Profile on target devices in profile/release modes

Conclusion
Understanding how widgets, render objects, and layers fit together unlocks the full power of Flutter’s rendering engine. With judicious use of `CustomPainter`, caching, and compositing, you can deliver visually rich UIs that stay within frame budgets even on lower-end devices.
