High-performing teams optimize for fast feedback and low coordination costs.

Principles:

- Short feedback loops — fast CI, quick code reviews, and reliable tests.
- Clear ownership — modules with maintainers and well-defined boundaries.
- Golden paths — linters, templates, and scripts for common flows.
- Visible work — dashboards for build health, release cadence, bug trends.

Practical tips:

1. Make `flutter test` fast; parallelize, and prune flaky integration tests.
2. Automate change logs and release notes from PR labels.
3. Adopt a small set of approved packages to reduce analysis paralysis.
4. Track DORA metrics and treat regressions as incidents.

The goal is less time coordinating and more time delivering value.
