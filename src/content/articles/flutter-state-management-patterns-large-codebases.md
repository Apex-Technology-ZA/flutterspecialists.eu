Why state management matters

- State management is how your app coordinates data flow between inputs, domain logic, and UI.
- At scale, the wrong choice results in tight coupling, difficult testing, poor runtime performance, and brittle features.
- The “best” pattern depends on constraints: team experience, codebase size, non-functional requirements (cold-start time, memory), and product roadmap.

This guide outlines a decision framework and a pragmatic combination strategy used in large, multi-team Flutter codebases.

Goals

- Predictable data flow and boundaries
- Testability of domain and UI layers
- Scalability for feature teams and platform squads
- Low cognitive load for developers

Common patterns

1. setState + InheritedWidget/InheritedModel

- Pros: simplest, minimal dependencies, good for leaf components and tiny apps
- Cons: quickly becomes unmaintainable at feature scale, implicit rebuilds are error-prone

2. Provider

- Pros: lightweight, good ergonomics, familiar to many teams
- Cons: composition with complex lifecycles can be tricky; advanced use cases drift toward Riverpod

3. Riverpod

- Pros: compile-time safety, testability, unidirectional flow, no BuildContext dependency for reads
- Cons: learning curve for providers graph and scoping; over-abstracting is easy

4. BLoC / Cubit

- Pros: mature pattern, event-driven, predictable transitions, excellent test story, clear state machines
- Cons: boilerplate, overkill for simple leaf widgets; some devs find streams excessive for local state

5. Redux (less common in 2025)

- Pros: single store predictability and dev tooling
- Cons: boilerplate heavy; opinion drift toward BLoC/Riverpod in Flutter ecosystem

A pragmatic layering model

- UI (Widgets): minimal ephemeral state (controllers, focus), delegate business data
- Feature State: localized Riverpod providers OR Cubits/BLoCs per feature
- Domain: use-cases/services (pure Dart), no Flutter imports
- Data: repositories/gateways talking to APIs/DBs; expose domain models or DTO mapping here

When to choose what

- Small features or leaf widgets
  - Use setState for purely ephemeral local UI concerns (text field, expansion tiles)
  - Use Provider/Riverpod for small but shared-UI state (e.g. filters)
- Complex feature flows (wizard, multi-step forms, background sync):
  - Riverpod or BLoC. If the flow is distinctly event-driven with an explicit state machine, BLoC shines.
  - If it is graph-like state dependencies (cache + network + debounced filters), Riverpod’s provider graph is ergonomic.
