When structuring a Flutter application, focus on boundaries and clarity:

- Separate UI from business logic and data access.
- Prefer composition over inheritance for widgets and behaviors.
- Encapsulate side effects in well-defined services.
- Use dependency inversion to enable unit testing in isolation.

Key layers:

1. Presentation — widgets, state, navigation, theming.
2. Domain — use cases, entities, validation, policies.
3. Data — repositories, API/DB clients, DTO mapping.

This separation allows features to evolve independently with confidence and speed.
